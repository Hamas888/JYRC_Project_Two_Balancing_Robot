# JYRC_Project_Two_Balancing_Robot
AT My university in the 6th semester of my Electronics degree we all had to take part in the junior year Robotics competition in teams of 3 people and all teams were given the same project to do and compete with each other to win it.

We all were given a two-wheel balancing robot that can follow lines avoid obstacles and can climb up bumps easily while maintaining balance. We can't use Arduino for this must use other controllers whichever we like.

we have to combine the course concepts of Control systems, Communication systems, and so on...

But at that time covid ruined and we all have to go home that's why the team cann't assemble a robot that it shited to Matlab and we all have to simulate it and we did.
