# JYRC_Project_Two_Balancing_Robot
AT My university in 6th semester of Electronics degree we all have to take part in the junior year Robotics competition in teams of 3 people and all teams have given the same project to do and compete with each other to win it.

We all were given Two wheel balancing robot which can follow line and avoid obstacle and can climb up bumps easily while maintaining balance. We cann't use arduino for this must use other controllers which ever we like.

we have to combine the course concepts of Control system, Communication systems and so on...

But at that time covid ruined all and we all have to go homes thats why the team cann't assemble a robot thats it shited to matlab and we all have to simulate it thats we did.
